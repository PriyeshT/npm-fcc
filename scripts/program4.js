//readFile Asynchronously using callbacks.
//For more info on callbacks - read [https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node#callbacks](https://github.com/max]

//Callbacks are functions that are executed asynchronously, or at a later time.
//Callbacks are just functions that get executed at some later time. The key to understanding callbacks is to realize 
//that they are used when you don't know when some async operation will complete, but you do know where the 
//operation will complete â€” the last line of the async function!
